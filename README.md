BitRatchet
----------

Simple class to allow you to read bits and bytes from a hex ascii string. Transparently deal with bits, reading the minimum amount of hex ahead.

(See test.php for more comprehensive example usage.)

Usage
-----

      require_once('bit_ratchet.php');
      $br = new BitRatchet("FF00FF");
      print "FF is " . $br->read(8) . "\n";
      print "00 is " . $br->read(8) . "\n";
      print "F is " . $br->read(4) . "\n";
      print "F is " . $br->read(4) . "\n";
      // Jump back to the start
      $br->jump(0);
      // Read FF as a signed number
      print "FF is -127: " . $br->read_signed(8) . "\n";
      // Print the last two bytes as hex
      print($br->read_ascii(2));
